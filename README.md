# EduPulse — Landing (React + Tailwind)

This repository contains the EduPulse landing and UI scaffold built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

What I added so far:
- Design tokens and Tailwind configuration
- `MainNav`, `HeroSection`, `ModulesSection`, `ReasonsSection`, and `Footer` components
- Lightweight `useInView` hook and reveal animations
- Accessibility improvements on nav and controls

Next steps:
- Accessibility audit
- Dev server smoke test
- Polish and documentation
